# kiss-somethingsomethingstatic


An experimental repo for building statically linked packages. 
I basiclly stole all packages from [KISS-static](https://github.com/dilyn-corner/kiss-static), and went from there. 
All packages in core *should* build successfully. 
However, I seem to end up not being able to build alot of things afterwards, due to various errors of different things are either missing or other stuff. 
I belive building a *complete* system first might be a better solution, then start building stuff statically afterwards might be a better approach than just trying to build it all static from scratch, due to alot of builds failing. 
further investigation and stealing of packages from Dilyn is required.
