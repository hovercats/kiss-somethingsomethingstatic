# kiss-somethingsomethingstatic

In this repo, I experiment with running a staticly linked KISS build.
I have mostly stolen from Dilyn's KISS-static, or KISS-me repositories, and gone on from there. 
All packages in Core is currently building as expected, some packages in extra does work aswell, but its a work in progress.
