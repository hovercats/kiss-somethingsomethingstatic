# Kiss-somethingsomethingstatic


An experimental KISS repository with goal of providing a fully working
statically linked enviroment.
We also aim to use alternative more minimalistic tools, whenever such options
are viable, and not without too much hassles. 


#### Overview:

Everything in this repo *should* build statically, however some exceptions
may exist. (See issues for more info.)
Unlike others before us we've set the appropriate flags per package,
and we will not be asking the user to set any flags globally, as its not needed.
This made more sense to us, as packages behave differently, aswell as having
different buildsystems and configurations.
Buildsystems and packages behaves differently, so there is no 'One shoe fits all'.
Some packages can build statically out of the box, while other needs more hands
on to build statically.


#### Contributions:

Contributions are welcomed.
Feel free to create an issue or PR if anythings comes to mind.
