# kiss-somethingsomethingstatic

An experimental repo for building statically linked packages. 
I basiclly stole all packages from [KISS-static](https://github.com/dilyn-corner/kiss-static), and went from there. 
All packages in core *should* build just fine, the rest is abit hit or miss. 
Once I get things working, it will be listed accordingly, so others may enjoy it too
