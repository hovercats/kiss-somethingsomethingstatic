Kiss-somethingsomethingstatic
________________________________________________________________________________

An experimental KISS repository with goal of providing a fully working
statically linked enviroment. All packages in this repo is built statically.
We also aim to use alternative more minimalistic tools, whenever such options
are viable, and not without too much hassles.
A list of used alternatives will be added later, once Ive switched over more
stuff than Ive done already.


Overview
________________________________________________________________________________

This is a highly experimental repo, and should be treated as such. It should
therefor not be considered a viable option for daily use. 
Unless your needs are so small it does not exceed the useage of TTY that is.

We also have an upstream repo; Kiss-dumpsterfire[0].
This is my personal repo, which currently holds alot more packages than this,
whereas alot of them is statically linked. If a package is missing from this
repo, have a peak at that, maybe its packaged there.
We also follow Kiss linux's official repo[1], aswell as Wyverkiss'[2] if
something important occurs, like patches and the like.


Converting
________________________________________________________________________________

Converting to a static system, is rather trivial, if things are configured
correctly, aswell as vital parts are not built in the wrong order.
If things are built in the wrong order, other packages will probably break,
due to mising .so files.
You can safely build packages that does not have any reverse dependencies,
because nothing depends on them, obviously. 
Now, for building things in the right order, youd have to build things in
reverse order of regular building. 
Lets have a few examples:
  
  - If you build curl statically, git will break
    - because git depends on libcurl.so
    - building git first, then curl, will however work.
  - for gcc, building binutils first, will break gcc.
    - same applies as above; gcc first, -> binutils -> ...

It imperative that you build things in the correct order when converting, unless
it will break, and having a broken compiler isnt a fun situation to be in.
Do yourself a favor and have a tarball at hand, so you can copy over the files
you need if something breaks.
