Kiss-somethingsomethingstatic
=============================

An experimental KISS repository using toybox, shinit and static linking.


Heres whats different to vanilla KISS:
-------------------------------------

- toybox instead of busybox
- shinit instead of busybox init
- new simpler init scripts now in /etc instead of /lib/init
    - system configurations should now also be simpler
- svc instead of busybox's runit
- static linking as default when possible
    - a goal would be to have everything statically linked
