Kiss-somethingsomethingstatic
=============================

An experimental KISS repository with goal of providing a fully working
statically linked enviroment.
We also aim to use more minimal tools, whenever such tools are a viable option.


Overview
--------

Everything in this repo *should* build statically, but see issues for possible
exceptions.
All packages should have the appropriate flags/configurations in their
buildscript, so no user interactions is needed at all.

Also worth noting:
This repo will only serve as a base, and if you wish to use this repo for
anything remotely usefull, youll need to figure out how to include the
neccessary shared libs, for i.e. mesa, llvm etc, while still building static
binaries.


Contributions
-------------

Contributions are welcomed.
If something isnt working, or something comes to mind, feel free to create an
issue, or a PR.
